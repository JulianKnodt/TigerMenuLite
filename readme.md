# TigerMenuLite

This was intended to be a Holiday Present for a member of my z-group, the O.G.
I couldn't send it over email so I created a git repo instead.

## Usage

Downloading the necessary files

`$ git clone git@github.com:JulianKnodt/TigerMenuLite.git`

Installing dependencies

```sh
$ cd TigerMenuLite
$ ./install.sh
```

Running the app

```sh
$ ./pton.js
OR
$ node pton.js
```

Happy holidays!
